function rvect = randomize(vect,SD,lowerlim,upperlim,singlerand)
% Takes a vector and a SD, and returns a vector where each element is
% randomized by the amount of the SD. 
% Elements are constrained between lowerlim and upperlim.
% If singlerand is true, then a single random number is used for the whole
% vector. If false, then each element is independently randomized.

if singlerand
    rvect = max(0,vect + vect * max(0.5,randn()) * SD); % We allow the prevalence to go down by 50%, up by any amount
